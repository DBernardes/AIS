Crystal quartz Lyot Depolarizer is made of two approximate wave plates of thickness 4 and 8 mm. 
Based on birefringence of crystal quartz at 400, 750 and 1100 nm, which is .00956, .00893 and .00871 respectively, 
phase shift in degrees between the two beams is 3.4427x10^7, 1.7153x10^7 and 1.1412x10^7 at 400, 750 and 1100 nm respectively. 
This is for 4 mm thick plate. For 8 mm thick plate phase shift will be respectively twice these numbers.
